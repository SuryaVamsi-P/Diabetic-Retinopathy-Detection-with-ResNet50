# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using ResNet-50

## Project Overview

This project presents a deep learning-based diagnostic solution for **early detection and classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**—a leading cause of vision loss among diabetic patients. Leveraging the power of **ResNet-50**, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), the model classifies high-resolution retinal images into five severity levels of DR:  

- 0 – No DR  
- 1 – Mild  
- 2 – Moderate  
- 3 – Severe  
- 4 – Proliferative DR  

Early detection of DR is crucial for timely medical intervention and preventing irreversible vision damage. This project serves as a decision-support tool for ophthalmologists and healthcare professionals by offering fast, automated classification of retinal images with strong accuracy.


## Key Highlights

- **Model Used:** ResNet-50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Techniques:** Image preprocessing, data augmentation, transfer learning, AUC & accuracy evaluation  
- **Performance:** Achieved **Training AUC: 97.77%**, **Validation AUC: 94%**  
- **Dataset:** APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset from Kaggle (35,000+ images)  
- **Problem Type:** Multi-class image classification (5 classes)


## Problem Statement

> Develop an automated deep learning model that can accurately detect and classify the stage of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images, minimizing manual screening time and increasing diagnostic efficiency.


## Project Workflow
